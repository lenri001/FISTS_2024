=====================================

The paper investigates the effectiveness of
transportation-based microgrid configurations in reducing
carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and electricity costs.  A
case study at the University of California, Riverside (UCR)
utilizes high resolution California Independent System
Operator (CAISO) CO2 emission data to assess the
environmental impact of each microgrid configuration.
Results prove that a load-following transportation
microgrid strategy can significantly reduce CO2 emissions,
while saving annual costs.

The paper is well written and organized. The topic is quite
interesting and worthy of investigation. 
I think that the paper can be accepted after a minor
revision. 
In particular:
1. A careful proofreading is needed - there are some typos
and grammatical errors through my reading;
2. Revise references list - there is a missing reference in
Sect. II-C.
