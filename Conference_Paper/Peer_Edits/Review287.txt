Comments to the author
======================

Review:

Fig 2 is a little unclear, grid is referring to a
grid-building connection meter? Is this internal to the EMS
of the building? How is this data collected and modelled in
Modelica?

Open Modelica seems to be able to understand 15 minute data
reasonably accuratly, does this hold true for EVSE use?
Typical EVSE use is relatively stochastic and depending on
state of charge, the draw can change. Is Modelica the best
tool to emulate the Lv 2 chargers? Perhaps better to
estimate the actual power profiles of specific vehicles
(there are not that many brands right now) rather than
generic simulation.

Fig 3 shows that the peak usage and charger draw happens in
the morning, this will be relatively important to capture,
are you using the actual data or the simulated session
data?

Fig 5 does not appear to give any additional information

Please, please break up that first paragraph into something
smaller. How does charge scheduling? Improve CO2 emisisons?

The key assertions related to previous studies are missing
citations. This is a very well explored area and your
implementation case appears to be very narrow. 
This is a case study but focuses only on simulated scope,
your study will benefit greatly from the added data of the
building. 
The written content does not flow well and the narrative is
impacted by the meandering logic at times. 
Peak shaving algorithms are fairly ubiquitous and should
cite the latest ones which account for all that has been
proposed.

CAISO's more recent data includes several new wind and
solar generation as well as increased demand from rapid ev
adoption during COVID. Why are you expressly removing these
effects?
