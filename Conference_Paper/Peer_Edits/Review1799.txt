Comments to the author
======================

The authors of “CO2 and Cost Impact Analysis of a Microgrid
with Electric Vehicle Charging Infrastructure: a Case Study
in Southern California” provide a numerical study in
OpenModelica with data from UC Riverside to understand the
effectiveness of microgrid configurations at reducing CO2
emissions. The study shows that the several features such
as microgrid structure, battery size, vehicle charger type
effect the power consumption and generation needs. I find
the work to be novel and interesting. I believe it should
be accepted.
Comments: 
-	there is a reference error on page 3
-	I find the literature review to be presented quite
thoroughly, but perhaps there are more related works that
should be cited. Nine research papers referenced is low.
-	Additionally, I think referencing a website for
numpy or other packages is irrelevant.
