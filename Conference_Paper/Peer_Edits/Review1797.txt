======================

This paper presents a case study of transportation-based
microgrid configuration impact on carbon dioxide (CO2)
emissions and electricity costs using real-world and
simulated data. The study demonstrates that a
load-following strategy of the transportation microgrid
configuration can effectively reduce CO2 emissions and
costs. Additionally, it highlights the importance of
optimizing battery capacity to strike a balance between
electricity cost and environmental impact.

Strengths:
+ The problem is well-motivated and well-written.
+ Extensive experiments are presented to validate the
proposed hypothesis using different battery sizes and EV
charging loads.

Weaknesses:
- The authors mentioned to have used a higher time
resolution (i.e., capturing data every 15 minutes) for
calculating CO2 emissions, which differs from existing
works. However, they did not compare their work with any
state-of-the-art works or explain the reasons for choosing
the 15-minute window.
- Typos on section I-B (i.e., traction)
- A reference is missing in Section II-C (i.e., ?)
