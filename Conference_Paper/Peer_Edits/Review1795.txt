======================

This paper explores the role of transportation-based
microgrid configurations in cutting down CO2 emissions and
reducing electricity costs within an Intelligent
Transportation System (ITS). Focusing on a case study at
the University of California, Riverside (UCR), it leverages
detailed CO2 emission data from the California Independent
System Operator (CAISO) to measure environmental impacts.
Additionally, it evaluates the potential savings in
electricity costs. 
The paper addresses a very interesting topic. It is well
written and very well presented. The results provided are
valuable. Overall, I recommend accepting this paper as is.

However, a carefull proofreading is needed since there are
some typos.
